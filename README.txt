What?
-----

A simple self-contained html-page to detect current ip and geo-location(approx.) using https://iplocate.io free & public api.

Why?
----

Personally, often need to check current ip and where it is connected when using vpn(private/work/uni etc..).
Most of ip-check services load 300kB+ pages just to show same information, but such bloat is unnecessary.
Most ip-check apis load json/csv, which are not "one-glance" readable.
